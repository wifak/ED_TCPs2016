# Dear Students,

Welcome to Technologies of Civic Participation (TCPs). I hope you will find this course insightful and you will enjoy taking part in our group activities and tutorial.

I will start with a brief personal introduction. I am a co-lecturer on this course and new to MUDR. I have also been teaching in Southampton University. Before that I was a research intern at Microsoft Research and a research fellow at LSE, where I completed a PhD in Information Systems. My research interests revolve around platforms, online communities and technologies of participation. Particularly, I study the long-term relationship between platform features and user generated content (UGC); how users engage with features (post, upload videos & pics, blog, comment, tweet) to build relationships and create social value (provide local knowledge, review, share experience, connect, participate in community activities, mobilise membership for political action, etc.) and how features’ performance change through use, making current understanding of participation, civic and political action constantly renegotiated and drifting.     
For this course, we will use a collaborative platform that is called Github. If you are a software developer, project manager, or tech writer, you will probably have heard or used Github before. But Github is not just a tool for software development. People around the world use GitHub to collaborate on projects ranging from software to policy documents and cookbooks. You can share a project and invite everyone to contribute, while GitHub uses Git (open source, distributed version control software) to keep track of every change made. This course’ videos, readings and collaborative records will be hosted on Github and open for everyone to use and fork. Your only responsibility is to read and contribute to the course’s content with your ideas, examples, reviews and any other input that you think is relevant to this course.      

This week's activities are:
(1) Attending W1 video lecture taking place …October at xpm UK time. You are invited to attend the video lecture although it will be made available on Github and Moodle for those of you who struggle with the time;
(2) Reading W1 key reading and have a look to W1 additional readings.
(3) Completing one W1 Reflective activity to be uploaded by … October, to allow time for feedback before W2 video lecture on … of October;
Looking forward to meet you online at tomorrow's virtual class, where additional details about the course will be given.

Best,

Dr. Wifak Gueddana
