# ED_TCPs2016

## Course Overview
TCPs have been defined as distributed, networked, inter-operable, digital innovations that facilitate the open discovery and sharing of information and the organisation of individuals for collective action. The focus of this course is on understanding the current and potential uses of new TCPs by citizens and policy-makers in responding to mundane, everyday threats to social resilience (e.g. street crime, problems with community service delivery, environment, health, etc.), and appreciating how these activities (e.g. monitoring, informing, reporting) are linked to everyday life in the community. An in-depth case study (TBC) will be developed to explore issues about using a platform to record or monitor civic participation. The course also includes delivery of a hands-on tutorial on the use of qualitative/quantitative analytical tools (TBC) to collect and process social media data (Twiiter, emails or others) for mapping relations, issues or others.

*This 10 credit course provides students with skills to (1) compare and interpret different visions (optimistic and critical) and strategies regarding how technologies may support civic participation; (2) understand the diversity of approaches for example when technologies are deployed by policymakers or by citizens/groups and differences between dedicated technologies and the use of general purpose (3) to engage with new practices emerging around monitoring social media data streams where a number of monitoring tools have emerged geared towards lay users.*
